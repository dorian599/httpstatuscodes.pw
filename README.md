# Http Status Codes Utility

Simple an easy to use utility for generating different HTTP Status Codes for test your apps, scripts, web servers or whatever you want.

It's simple, just add the HTTP Status Code you want to test in the URL like this:

[httpstatuscodes.pw/code/200](http://httpstatuscodes.pw/code/200)

So you'll get a response like this

`{"message":"HTTP Status Code","code":"200"}`

Happy coding.
